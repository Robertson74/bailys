<!--
Step One - Make a Reservation
Select a date and start time for your event.  Parties are continuously booked throughout the year on a first come first served basis.  The month of December is especially busy. You can check availability in the side bar on the right. 

Your event must begin and end within the following meal periods.

Breakfast 9:00am - 1:00pm

Lunch 11:00am - 4:00pm

Dinner 5:00pm - 9:30pm

Nightclub 10:00pm - 2:00am

To book an event, a non-refundable deposit of $100 (cash or credit card) will be required. At this time the Events Manager can answer any questions you may have.

Step Two - Select Your Menu Items
As a general rule, our pre-composed menus provide the most value and simplify the menu selection process.

For custom menus, determine the number of courses you would like for your meal (two course minimum). Select the items in each course from the appropriate menu (menus are not interchangeable). Below each menu section title is the number of selections to make per course.

If required, wine selections may be made to match your budget and taste. The full wine list is available on the website. If you care to bring in wine that we do not offer on our wine list we charge a $15.00 corkage fee per 750ml bottle.

Step Three - Call to finalize the details
To ensure ingredient availability, call the events manager 10 days prior to the event to formalize the menu selections and your guaranteed guest count. If you would like printed personalized menus share the exact text with the Events Manager. We will email or fax the contract for your review and approval. Sign the contract acknowledging you agree upon the minimum food and beverage amount, the menu selections, and the guaranteed number of people.

Other Considerations

Getting in Touch with Us
Based on business requirements, our Events Manager keeps flexible daytime hours Monday - Friday.  You may contact the Events Manager at 951-676-9567 ext. 107.  Always leave a voice mail for a prompt return call no later than the end of the next business day.

Email (events@oldtowndining.com) is great way to document the inevitable back and forth dialog that occurs as we plan your event. 

Additionally, last minute minor changes, such as a late arrival or a variation in number of guests, can be handled by a dining room manager.  Just dial 951-676-9567 for such occurrences.

Table Configurations
Our staff is trained to accommodate special table configurations.  However, because of room capacities and the availability of tables and chairs we may be unable to facilitate special requests.  In some of these cases accommodations can be made with the rental of additional equipment at the expense of the client.

End Time
Please keep in mind the “end time” of your party.  Due to consecutive bookings during peak times (Friday and Saturday), we require that guests adhere to the end time of their party.  This allows our staff to prepare the room for subsequent events.  You will be charged a late fee of $50.00 if your party exceeds the end time by more than 10 minutes.

Payments & Billing
A 50% installment will be required a week prior to your event.

Your final bill will be the tally of all food and beverage charged at the contracted/menu price.  All purchases are subject to sales tax and a 20% service charge.  If the tally does not meet the food and beverage minimum the difference will be billed as a room charge and/or unmet minimum.

If your bill exceeds the minimum food and beverage charge as defined above, then you will be charged the actual amount of the food and beverage purchases, plus tax and a 20% service charge.

Payment for any rentals, which are coordinated by the Events Manager, will be paid in full (including tax on the rentals) two weeks prior to the event.
